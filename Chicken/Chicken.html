        <p></p><h3>Chicken</h3>
        <li>1 (1.25 pound) package bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon garlic powder, or to taste</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <p></p><h3>Seasoned Flour</h3>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons smoked paprika</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons onion powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <p></p><h3>Gravy</h3>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>8 ounces button mushrooms, sliced</li>
        <li>1 shallot, sliced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 cup chicken bone broth</li>
        <li>1 cup evaporated milk</li>
        <li>parsley, for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p><h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Season both sides of chicken thighs with salt, pepper, and garlic powder</li>
        <li>For seasoned flour, whisk flour, garlic powder, smoked paprika, onion powder, salt, and pepper together in a shallow bowl. Set aside 3 tablespoons of seasoned flour.</li>
        <li>Dredge chicken in remaining seasoned flour; set aside on a plate.</li>
        <li>Heat a cast iron skillet over medium heat; melt butter with olive oil. Fry chicken in the skillet until both sides are golden brown, about 7 minutes per side. They will not be completely cooked.</li>
        <li>Remove chicken from the skillet. Add shallot and mushrooms to the skillet, and cook and stir until softened, about 3 minutes. Stir in garlic, and saut√© until fragrant, about 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the reserved seasoned flour over the mixture. Blend until a smooth paste forms. Slowly whisk in bone broth, continue whisking and add evaporated milk.</li>
        <li>Return chicken thighs to the skillet, cover, and reduce heat to low; continue cooking until the an instant read thermometer inserted near the center of thighs reaches 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
